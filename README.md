Welcome! To the Durham Tax Hub Repository
===

A small tour is where things must begin....

The bare bones, raw, stripped down, less than nothing, ever incomplete, dust trailing, hair splittingly empty theme Underscores is where we begin.

This will be the foundation for everything we build on. Styles, structure, plugins, behavior etc..


-- 1. PRODUCTION --

* We will WORK on the production branch
* We will PUSH to the production branch
* (1st stage of development)


-- 2. DEVELOP --

* We will push production TO develop
* We will work with develop to squeeze out bugs
* (2nd stage of development)


-- 3. STAGING --

* We will push develop TO staging
* We will work with staging as a last call to find errors
* (3rd stage of development)


-- 4. MASTER --

* We will push staging TO master
* This is it, everything we worked for. In the Master.
* DO NOT DEVELOP HERE! If I see individual development with single commits I will be furious. Don't do it. For real...
* (FINAL STAGE)



Getting Started
---------------

If you want to keep it simple, head over to https://underscores.me and generate your `_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the "Generate" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.

If you want to set things up manually, download `_s` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `_s` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium-is-awesome`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.
